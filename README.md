# Tic Tac Toe Minimax

A Python implementation of Minimax AI Algorithm for the game Tic Tac Toe.

## How to Play

Run program to start playing. Choose preferred icon "X" or "O" and whether to start first or second. Choose whether AI runs minimax or randomly places move on board.

## Demonstration

This algorithm searches recursively for the best move to win or try to draw. It looks at the current board state and possible moves. For each possible moves it predicts where the other player would play until the game is over with either player winning or draw.

### Minimax

![]()

![]()

### Random

## Limitations

Minimax assumes that the other player is playing optimally, or in this case, the human player is making moves to minimize the score. This can lead to interesting moves made by the AI as shown below.
